Bill  generation


## üìù Description

This is a simple console-based Java application designed to manage customer information, vehicle details, and generate service invoices for an automotive garage. It provides a basic interface for adding new customers and creating detailed bills for services rendered.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Customer Management:** Add new customer profiles with name, phone, car number, and car model.
* **Invoice Generation:** Create detailed invoices for customers, allowing selection of multiple services from a predefined list.
* **Service Tracking:** Displays available services with their names and prices.
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Structured using clear, modular classes (`Car`, `Customer`, `Service`, `Invoice`, `GarageService`, `GarageBillingAPP`) demonstrating core OOP principles.
* **Interactive Console Interface:** User-friendly menu-driven interaction through the command line.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Java 8+** (or your specific Java version)
* **Core Java Collections:** `java.util.Map` (HashMap) for efficient customer lookup, `java.util.List` (ArrayList) for managing services.
* **`java.util.Scanner`** for user input.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
2.  **Compile the Java files:**
    Navigate to the `src` directory (or wherever your `.java` files are located) and compile them. If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, it will usually handle compilation automatically.
    ```bash
    # Example if your .java files are directly in the root or 'src' folder
    javac -d out src/*.java 
    # Or if you have a package structure, e.g., com.yourcompany.garage
    # javac -d out src/com/yourcompany/garage/*.java 
    # Adjust 'src' and 'out' based on your actual project structure
    ```
    *Self-correction/Tip:* A more robust way for a small project is to ensure all classes are in the same directory for simple compilation, or use a basic `Makefile` if you prefer CLI compilation without an IDE's build system. For a simple project like this, putting all `.java` files in one folder (e.g., `src`) and then compiling them together is often easiest.

3.  **Run the application:**
    After successful compilation, navigate to the output directory (e.g., `out`) and run the main class.
    ```bash
    java -cp out GarageBillingAPP
    ```
    (Replace `GarageBillingAPP` if your main class is named differently)

## üí° How to Use

Once the application is running, you will be presented with a console menu:
